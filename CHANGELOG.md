## [1.3.0]

- Files indexing received a big performance boost - ~2 times faster than it was before:
  - Is now performed in background, which means it is not blocking other features of the LSP.
  - Is now clustered - the number of processes depends on the number of cores on your machine.
  - Is now incremental, which means a file will be available as soon as it is indexed.

## [1.4.0]

- New provider: [Diagnostics](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/programmatic-language-features#provide-diagnostics).

## [1.4.1]

- Fixed compiler `-i` parameter for Darwin and Linux operating systems.
- The tokenization process now supports function definitions spread over multiple lines.
